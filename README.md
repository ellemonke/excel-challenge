# excel-challenge
In this challenge, we worked with real data from Kickstarter.com containing over 4,000 campaigns from 2009-2017. We were tasked to analyze the success, failure, and cancellation rates across categories and determine if there were any patterns.

I used Excel pivot tables, line graphs and bar charts, cell formulas and conditional formatting:

1. I used conditional formatting to color cells and use formulas for number, date, text formatting and countifs.
2. I created stacked bar charts based on a pivot tables including filters. They showed the number of successful, failed and cancelled campaigns per Category and Sub-Category.
3. I created line graphs based on pivot tables including filters. One chart showed campaign outcomes based on date and another based on the original goal amount.
4. I wrote a report of my findings that identified categories with the most success and possible reasons based on the data. I also suggested additional analyses that could be performed and potential improvements to the data set.
